# frontend_store
FrontEnd Store is a virtual store so that a business can show its products and the customer can see products, choose quantity options, sizes, etc. 
In this project I deepened knowledge of HTML and CSS such as Flexbox, CSS Grid properties, use the VEM approach 
and the Responsively app for a page that is responsive on all types of devices.
Code made with Visual Studio Code, interactive device visuals made with Responsively App and deploy made with Netlify. Enjoy! ðŸš€
